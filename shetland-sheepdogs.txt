The Shetland Sheepdog

With fur like autumn's golden flame,
A collie's grace in smaller frame,
The Sheltie stands on nimble feet,
Where Scottish winds and moorlands meet.

Alert ears catch the faintest sound,
A shepherd's heart, forever bound
To flocks that wander, hills that call,
This little dog can herd them all.

Those eyes of brown, so deep and wise,
Reflect the vast and endless skies
Of Shetland Isles, where storms run free,
And waves crash wild against the sea.

A loyal friend, a joyful soul,
Who makes a fractured spirit whole,
With silken mane and bark so bright,
The Sheltie fills our lives with light.
