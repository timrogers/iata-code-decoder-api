# IATA Code Decoder API

A simple API, written in Node.js with the Express framework, which allows you to identify airports, airlines and aircraft by their IATA code.

This project provides two interfaces:
1. **REST API**: Traditional HTTP endpoints for looking up IATA codes
2. **MCP Server**: A Model Context Protocol server for AI systems and other MCP clients

This is used by my [IATA Code Decoder extension](https://github.com/timrogers/raycast-iata-code-decoder) for [Raycast](https://raycast.com).

The data in the API is cached version of the airport, airline and aircraft data from the [Duffel](https://duffel.com) API. We use a cached copy for speed because the Duffel API does not allow you to view all records in one response - you can only see up to 200 at a time.

The cached data is updated regularly thanks to the power of GitHub Actions ðŸ‘¼

## Usage

### REST API

The REST API provides HTTP endpoints for looking up IATA codes.

## Running locally with Node

1. Make sure you're running Node.js v18 (v18.7.0 is recommended).
2. Install the dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Start the application by running `npm run dev`. You'll see a message once the app is ready to go.
4. Hit <https://localhost:4000/airports?query=LHR> in your browser. You'll see information about Heathrow airport ðŸ¥³

### Updating cached data

The cached data is updated regularly and committed to the repository thanks to the power of GitHub Actions. You can also do this locally yourself.

1. Make sure you're running Node.js v18 (v18.7.0 is recommended).
2. Install the dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Set your Duffel access token. Make a copy of the example `.env` file with `cp .env.example .env`, and then edit the resulting `.env` file.
4. Run `npm run generate-airports && rpm run generate-airlines && npm run generate-aircraft`. Commit the result.

## Running locally wih Docker

1. Build the Docker image with `docker build . -t timrogers/iata-code-decoder-api`
2. Start a container using your built Docker image by running `docker run -d -p 4000:4000 timrogers/iata-code-decoder-api`
3. Hit <https://localhost:4000/airports?query=LHR> in your browser. You'll see information about Heathrow airport ðŸ¥³

### MCP Server

The MCP (Model Context Protocol) server provides tools for AI systems to look up IATA codes.

To start the MCP server:
```bash
npm run mcp-server
```

For detailed information about the MCP server, see [MCP_README.md](MCP_README.md).
4. To stop your container - because you're done or because you want to rebuild from step 1, run `docker kill` with the container ID returned from `docker run`.
